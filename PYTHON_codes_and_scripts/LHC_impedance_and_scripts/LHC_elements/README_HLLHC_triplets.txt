# concerning triplets: latest info from R. Kersevan (feb. 2014)
- 4% of surface coverage by holes is pessimistic, depends a lot on
pumping speed which increases with temperature (so it could be much less),
- now only 15 lines of holes because one is taken by the weld,
- now baseline is only 1mm thickness for beam-screen (stainless steel).
