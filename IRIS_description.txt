Repository of N. Mounet codes:
IRIS (for Impedance, Resistive-Wall & Instabilities codes and Scripts)

This repository contains various codes and scripts to compute impedance and instabilities, written in PYTHON and C++, in particular:
- DELPHI: C++ code (stand-alone and shared library) to compute eigenfrequencies (tuneshifts and growth rates) of
modes for and coupling-impedance/damper system (Vlasov solver), in mode-coupling regime (azimuthal and radial modes)
- ImpedanceWake2D: C++ code (stand-alone and shared library) to compute resistive-wall impedance & wake functions of 
flat or round multilayer 2D structures,
- Laclare: C++ code (stand-alone) to compute eigenfrequencies (tuneshifts and growth rates) from a coupling-impedance
alone, in weak headtail (low intensity) regime,
- PYTHON_codes_and_scripts: many Python codes and scripts:
	* Impedance python library (library to compute impedance models, including a wrapper for ImpedanceWake2D),
	* DELPHI python library (also contains a wrapper for the MOSES code of Y. Chin),
	* Some general purpose python modules,
	* HEADTAIL postprocessing scripts,
	* Data analysis scripts,
	* LHC & HL-LHC impedance model generation (including data files with parameters and betan functions),
	and scripts for complex tuneshifts computation,
	* Other machines (SPS, LEP, TLEP, VHE-LHC, ALBA, VEPP) scripts to compute complex tuneshifts, 
	and sometimes impedance models
	* Others,
- External_libs: 
	* External python modules (numpy, scipy and matplotlib) in a version compatible with the content of the repository,
	* External ALGLIB library for the ImpedanceWake2D code (C++ library for computations with high precision numbers).
- SUSSIX: Sussix code (R. Bartolini - F. Schmidt, CERN SL/Note 98-017 (AP) - 1998) for high accuracy spectral analysis,
with python wrappers from Rogelio Tomas & Benoit Salvant.
- Getting_LHC_beta_functions: a collection of madx and matlab scripts to easily compute and extract
beta functions for all elements defined in the LHC & HL-LHC impedance models (used to obtain beta functions in
files contained in PYTHON_codes_and_scripts/LHC_impedance_and_scripts/LHC_elements), from optics files in the
official repositories.
